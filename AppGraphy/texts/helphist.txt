A histogram is a chart that plots the distribution of a numeric
variable’s values as a series of bars. Each bar typically covers
a range of numeric values called a bin or class; a bar’s height
indicates the frequency of data points with a value within the
corresponding bin.

Histograms are good for showing general distributional features of
dataset variables. You can see roughly where the peaks of the 
distributionare, whether the distribution is skewed or symmetric, 
and if thereare any outliers. 

COMMON MISUSE WHILE PLOTTING THE HISTOGRAM:
1) Mesured variable is not continuous numaric
2) Using unequal bin size
