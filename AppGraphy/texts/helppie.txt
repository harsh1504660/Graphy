A pie chart shows how a total amount is divided between levels of a 
categorical variable as a circle divided into radial slices. Each 
categorical value corresponds with a single slice of the circle, and 
the size of each slice (both in area and arc length) indicates what 
proportion of the whole each category level takes.

Pie charts have a fairly narrow use-case that is encapsulated 
particularly well by its definition. In order to use a pie chart, 
you must have some 
kind of whole amount that is divided into a number of distinct parts. 
Your primary objective in a pie chart should be to compare each group 
contribution to the whole, as opposed to comparing groups to each 
other.If the above points are not satisfied, the pie chart is not 
appropriate, and a different plot type should be used instead.
