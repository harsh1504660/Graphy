A scatter plot (aka scatter chart, scatter graph) uses dots to 
represent values for two different numeric variables. The position 
of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for 
an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe 
relationships between variables.

Scatter plotsâ€™ primary uses are to observe and show relationships 
between two numeric variables. The dots in a scatter plot not only 
report the values of individual data points, but also patterns when 
the data are taken as a whole.

COMMON MISUSE :
1) Overplotting-
Overplotting is the case where data points overlap to a degree where 
we have difficulty seeing relationships between points and variables. 
It can be difficult to tell how densely-packed data points are when 
many of them are in a small area.

2) Unequal number of x and y variables
3) no numaric data
