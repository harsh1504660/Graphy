A line chart (aka line plot, line graph) uses points connected by line 
segments from left to right to demonstrate changes in value. The 
horizontal axis depicts a continuous progression, often that of time, 
while the vertical axis reports values for a metric of interest across 
that progression.

You will use a line chart when you want to emphasize changes in values 
for one variable (plotted on the vertical axis) for continuous values 
of a second variable (plotted on the horizontal). This emphasis on 
patterns of change is sold by line segments moving consistently from 
left to right and observing the slopes of the lines moving up or down.
An important aspect of creating a line chart is selecting the right 
interval or bin size. For temporal data, a too-broad of a measurement 
interval may mean that it takes too long to see where the data trend 
is leading, hiding away the useful signal. On the flip side of the 
coin, a too-short a measurement interval may only reveal noise rather 
than signal.

COMMON MISUSE :
1) Strictly using a zero base line
2) Using a mislading dual axis
3) enequal number of x and y variables
4) Use of characters as a data
