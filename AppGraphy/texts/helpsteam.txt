A stemplot is like a histogram â€” they are both tools to help you 
visualize a data set. Stemplots show a little more information 
than a histogram and have been a common tool for displaying data
sets since the 1970s. They are typically used when there is a 
medium amount of quantitative variables to analyze; Stemplots of 
more than 50 observations are unusual. The name Stem plot comes 
because there is one 'stem' with the largest place-value digits 
to the left (shaded in gray in the image below) and one 'leaf' 
to the right.

A stem and leaf plot is a way to plot data where the data is 
split into stems (the largest digit) and leaves (the smallest digits)
. They were widely used before the advent of the personal computer, 
as they were a fast way to sketch data distributions by hand. They 
are used less frequently today, but you'll still see some here and 
there.

Stemplots are made up of a stem (usually the highest place value 
digit) and 'leaves', which are the digits or units. For example, 
a simple stemplot of 10,21 and 32 would have tens as the highest 
order digits and 0,1, and 2 as the leaves. Think of a stemplot as 
being a histogram or bar chart made from actual numbers instead of 
blocks.
