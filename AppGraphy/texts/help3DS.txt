3D scatter plots are used to plot data points on three axes in the
attempt to show the relationship between three variables. Each row
in the data table is represented by a marker whose position depends
on its values in the columns set on the X, Y, and Z axes.

A fourth variable can be set to correspond to the color or size of
the markers, thus adding yet another dimension to the plot.

The relationship between different variables is called correlation.
If the markers are close to making a straight line in any direction
in the three-dimensional space of the 3D scatter plot, the correlation
between the corresponding variables is high. If the markers are equally
distributed in the 3D scatter plot, the correlation is low, or zero.
However, even though a correlation may seem to be present, this might
not always be the case. The variables could be related to some fourth
variable, thus explaining their variation, or pure coincidence might
cause an apparent correlation.

You can change how the 3D scatter plot is viewed by zooming in and
out as well as rotating it by using the navigation controls located
in the top right part of the visualization.
