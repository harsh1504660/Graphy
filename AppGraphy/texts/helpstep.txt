A step chart can be useful when you want to show the changes that 
occur at irregular intervals. For example, the price rise in milk 
products, petrol, tax rate, interest rates, etc.

The step() function designs the plot such that, it has a horizontal 
baseline to which the data points will be connected by vertical 
lines. This kind of plot is used to analyze at which points the 
change in Y-axis value has occurred exactly with respect to X-axis. 
This is very useful in discrete analysis. The step plotting can be 
combined with any other plots. The occurrence of steps can also be 
formatted by supplying appropriate parameter values. The parameters 
for this function are tabulated below.

COMMON MISUSE :
1) Unequal size of data
2) Used for reguler intervals
